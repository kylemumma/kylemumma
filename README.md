### Hi there, I'm Kyle (he/him)ðŸ‘‹

- :school: Iâ€™m entering my 4th year studying computer science @ [the University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/)
- :computer: Right now, i'm at Google for the summer, where i'm contributing to a unit testing tool in the linux kernel called [KUnit](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/tools/testing/kunit)!
- :open_book: Currently i'm enjoying learning about the linux operating system and operating systems programming :)
- :page_facing_up: If you want to learn more about me, the most up to date information will probably be [my resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ECpIr0EJfdLCE3vOac0wa4Vt0QUQxoALtNRZ_Dh0P5M/edit?usp=sharing)
